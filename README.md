# Jellui - A rudimentary OpenGL-based user interface framework, in Go

This is a simple user interface framework, written in, and for, Go.
Based on OpenGL, it provides layered areas and event distribution, as well as simple controls (labels, buttons, combo boxes).

This is a quick-and-dirty framework, meant to be only for my personal projects.
If you find use in it, feel free to do so, and beware it might break at any time.
